#This is the output of running both sorts with my main driver.

Hello. This program tests the average swaps, comparisons, and computing time of running two different sorts on arrays of random numbers of size 1000, 10000, and 100000.
Please choose from the following options:
(1) Test with Selection Sort
(2) Test with Merge Sort
(3) Exit the program
Option:1
Now testing the selection sort and taking the average of 10 sorts on an originally unsorted array...
The average number of swaps for small array was: 999
The average number of comparisons for small array was: 499500
The average time for the small array in seconds was: 0.00117581
The average number of swaps for medium array was: 9999
The average number of comparisons for medium array was: 49995000
The average time for the medium array in seconds was: 0.115644
The average number of swaps for large array was: 99999
The average number of comparisons for large array was: 4999950000
The average time for the large array in seconds was: 12.9839
