/*
When applied on a sorted or almost sorted array, the Insertion Sort gives optimal
performance. This is because its complexity in near sorted or sorted case
is O(n), where the other divide and conquer algorithms would simply have
to go through the process of dividing/partitioning and moving items in or between
arrays.

/*The circular array can be used to provide a flexible array-based implemenation
of a queue because you can reuse an array by returning to the front of it circularly
using a simple divison, and only keeping track of the array to see if its full with
an external value like DEFAULT_CAPACITY, or when front catches up to back of the queue.
